                    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
                    <p>The charts above display positive correlations between risk factors obesity and smoking in relation to poverty and household income. The visible trend indicates that less affluent and poorer states have higher obesity rates and greater
                        tendencies of smoking. Wealthier states not only had higher rates of healthcare coverage, but lower obesity and smoking rates. The visualizations also indicate that the trends are not absolute because there are some clear outliers.
                        For example, there are states such as North Dakota and Iowa with relatively low poverty and high obesity rates.</p>

                    <p>The correlations between health risks and age are more convoluted. The median ages in most US states are between 36-40 years old. This clustered the visualizations making them more difficult to identify. However, a keen eye would be
                        able to see that there are indeed some correlations, such as: higher median age and higher healthcare coverage, lower median age and lower smoking rates, and finally, lower median age and lower obesity rates.</p>
